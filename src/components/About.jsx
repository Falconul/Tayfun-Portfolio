        Hello! I'm Tayfun Deniz, a passionate software developer with a love for technology and continuous learning. I graduated from BalÄ±kesir University, where I developed a strong foundation in computer science and programming.

        <strong>My Journey</strong><br />
        I started my career working on CAD/CAM software, where I designed and optimized computer-aided manufacturing processes. This experience honed my technical skills and sparked my interest in web development and software engineering. Currently, I am proficient in HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and C#. While I have a strong understanding of frontend technologies, I am continuously improving my backend skills to become a well-rounded developer.

From interactive front-end designs to functional back-end systems, each project reflects my commitment to quality and innovation. I enjoy collaborating with others and am always open to learning new things and tackling challenging problems. I am not afraid to ask questions when I encounter unfamiliar concepts because I believe that asking questions is essential for growth and understanding.

        <strong>Beyond Coding</strong><br />
        Outside of programming, I enjoy exploring new technologies and staying updated with industry trends. I am dedicated to improving my skills and contributing to meaningful projects that make a difference.
